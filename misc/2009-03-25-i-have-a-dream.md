Wouldn't it be quite nice if there was a django-pluggable in which let's you edit a few configs and suddenly your project knows where and how it has to be deployed? Then all there's left to do is hack in ./manage deploy watch a few log entries scroll by and bingo: new version running on the server. That would be quite cool wouldn't it?

Well let's see - perhaps I'll sit down sometime and hack something together.
