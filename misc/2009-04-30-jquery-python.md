Okay I got another nice idea for a (not so) little project I should start sometime. Why is it, that you can do these really amazing queries with jQuery, which is written in stupid old JavaScript while you have to traverse till gray matter drops out of your ears which real programming languages like Python?

To be honest I never really thought of [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) as the holy grail of HTML parsing. Why you ask? Cause I can't even select the last sub-object of a DOM object without traversing my shoes off.

There has to be some smarter way.
