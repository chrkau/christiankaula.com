Sometimes I don't get people: "Oh heck what was my ICQ again? Could you give it to me?" Or how about "Oh... what was my login and pass for my web space again?"

Know this kind of statement? Did you ever say that? Well the solution is really simple: Write it down. Or even better: Encrypt all your login data with *one good* password. [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) respectively [KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org/) have been a great little tool for me on Windows, Linux and my trusty old Macs.
