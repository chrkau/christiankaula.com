Okay I couldn't come up with a witty title this time - sue me. But nevertheless I have a real treat for you today. Sure we all use Photoshop and there surly isn't anything that can compare. Yeah, yeah we know that. But *what about those times you fire up the big beast that Photoshop is just to edit some tiny little graphic* or need to come up with a simple icon?

Now that is when you fire up [Pixen](http://opensword.org/Pixen/) which pretty much is loaded instantly. This thing is *made for pixel artists* so it shines with all things small. *Icons*? Check. *Avatars*? Sure. Perhaps one of those *hip stripe backgrounds*? Please go ahead. Or perhaps you need an *animated GIF*? Pixen does it. So please, please do me a favor and grab a copy of Pixen. That thing is just so much fun to use.
