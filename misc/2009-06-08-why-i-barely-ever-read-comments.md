Alright, after some out-time mainly due to work-overload in the last few weeks (and the general laziness of my person) let's see what we can do.

Yesterday I checked on [Smashing Magazine](www.smashingmagazine.com) and saw there was another article about Macs. That's nice and stuff and sometimes I even find some interesting info in those but it definitely always means one thing: Flames, flames and even more flames - and then some.

Every time I see one of those comments among the lines of 'this is why Macs suck and Windows is the only real thing' or 'this is why Windows sucks and Macs are the real thing' I cannot help and wonder if some of those are actually paid. I mean there can't be that many stupid people, right?

â€¦right?

I probably still haven't lost my faith in humanity somehow.
