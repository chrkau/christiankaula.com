Okay so yesterday I talked about how Snow Leopard went random on me when it comes to switching keyboard layouts. Disregard that. Turns out I had the keyboard shortcut assigned twice (well I guess one could argue that the leopard shouldn't do that).

Talking about keyboard shortcuts: the new menu is great. Sure, a endless list with about 400 entries is fun and all but splitting it up into categories doesn't seem the worst idea to me.

And one more thing: It appears Quicklook learned quite a few new formats. Most code even gets highlighted now.
