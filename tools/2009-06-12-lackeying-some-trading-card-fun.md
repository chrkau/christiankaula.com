Just the other day I tried [LackeyCCG](http://www.lackeyccg.com/) which allows you to play different trading card games (Magic and WoW amongst others) over the net. I didn't have time to really play a game with somebody yet, but this seems really interesting.

Don't get me wrong I love me old Magic cards - but these thingies do get expansive if you really want a nice deck. Furthermore the layout of the new cards is quite… lacking in my eyes. Though I heard there will be a major rules revamp with [Magic 2010](http://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/27a) next month. Let's see what that brings. Who knows I might even buy some cards again.
