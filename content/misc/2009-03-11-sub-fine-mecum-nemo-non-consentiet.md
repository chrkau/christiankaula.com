I find it interesting that everybody that had the chance (was forced) to work on a Mac for a period of time buys one sooner or later. Most probably do cause these thingies are really good lookin' - I'm not deluding myself there. But I also think that once used to Mac OS nobody really wants to go back to Windows that soon.
