So you're coding for a living and every few minutes there is this snippet of code you would like to keep around just in case but don't know where to put it? Or perhaps you're one of these people that have great ideas constantly but just never got a piece of paper?

Well in both cases you should check out [Sidenote](http://www.chatelp.org/?p=50). It's quite a smart little tool that hides behind the edge of your monitor until you need it. Then it scrolls out smoothly and is ready to take your color coded, date sorted notes of any kind.
