Everybody should always have at least one copy of [Worms Armageddon](http://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/) on every computer available. It's just one of the best and timelessest (that isn't a word is it?) games ever made. It's got everything: strategy, tactic, skill and the insane laughter that follows the blasting 5 worms with a Mad Cow Herd dropped while dangling from a Ninja Rope. And with all that it's easy to learn and hard to master.

And besides all that this game is this game so old (and still quite up-to-date through patches) that it has no hardware and or software requirements to speak of. But the kicker is this: This game costs next to nothing these days. So what the heck are you waiting for? Get this game - and while you're at it buy a copy for your friends too.
