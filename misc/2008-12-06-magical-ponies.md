As you can plainly see I'm a big fan of the new (still) unofficial Django mascot: the magical [Django Pony](http://www.djangopony.com/).

A mascot gives a face to a product and helps recognition while burning the image into the brain on first exposure. This works pretty well with pink, magical ponies I guess. ("What the heck is that pony doing there?")

Even though pink ponies rock I have to admit the [green version](http://avalonstar.com/blog/2008/sep/9/web-framework-ponies/) suits the Django style a good bit better.
