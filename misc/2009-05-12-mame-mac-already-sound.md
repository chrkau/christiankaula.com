Yesterday I wanted to install [MAME](http://mamedev.org/) on my MacBook to always have some classy arcade action with me on the go. So my first stop is [MAME OS X](http://mameosx.sourceforge.net/) of course. It's got all the MAME fun in a nice clean package, all ready for some delicious Mac gaming.

Then I made the mistake to check what the actual status of MAME itself is just in case they now have some total far out feature I haven't heard of, yet. After realizing they finally have a homepage that doesn't look like it's been designed around 1998 (hey who knows... MAME *is* kinda old) and is even pretty slick looking, I see the newest version is 0.130. MAME OS X in it's latest release uses 0.124. Well I cannot have that, of course.

So after some searching and some more searching and yet some more, I finally found [SDLMAME binaries for Mac OS X](http://sdlmame.parodius.com/). Which didn't work and instead complained about missing SDL libraries. So I start to worry that I would have to compile SDL now and that it all would end in tears. Well nope, just had to go to the [SDL homepage](http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) and download the Mac SDL framework. 

Now all I did was configure MAME to use OpenGL (-video opengl - actually I put it into mame.ini) to get better speeds, and that was that. Until I realized I didn't have any games to play...
