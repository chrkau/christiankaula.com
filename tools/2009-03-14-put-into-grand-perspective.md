I've been searching for a Mac app that allows me to see where all my precious hard drive space has gone. There is quite a nice little app called [SequoiaView](http://w3.win.tue.nl/nl/onderzoek/onderzoek_informatica/visualization/sequoiaview//) which is really good at that task - sadly it's not available for my beloved Mac.

[Grand Perspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) to the rescue! This thingie does exactly what I want it to and even looks better than SequoiaView. Well you know - we Mac people are suckers for looks.
