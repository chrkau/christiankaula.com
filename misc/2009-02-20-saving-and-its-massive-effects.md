The 21. Keeper is in the embassy. But cause there's a bug it isn't visible most of the time. Simply enter the room, save and load the savegame.

If you don't know what I'm talking about: get Mass Effect. It's a pretty cool game - especially story wise. But blasting aliens with full automatic rifles and shotguns also has a certain entertainment factor.
