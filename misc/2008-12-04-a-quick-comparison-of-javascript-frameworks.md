I think I used [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) wrong up to now. One should probably code a lot more object oriented to not produce whole KLOCs for simple stuff.

So to do some testing I created a few mini projects to compare MooTools, [Mochikit](http://mochikit.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Dojo](http://www.dojotoolkit.org/). And I guess I slowly begin to understand why everybody and his dog uses jQuery. When it comes to amount of source needed for one functionality this thing beats them all. Seems they really mean it  when they say 'write less do more'.

Mochikit I don't get. The documentation they give as one of their strongest points didn't help me at all. There are a few examples, but no really simple examples. Really, really bad for me. I just couldn't figure out how all that Deffered stuff is supposed to work.
