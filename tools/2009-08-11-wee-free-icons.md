I'm talking about the little images - not the star people everybody goes crazy about. Anyway, after having used the [Silk Icons](http://famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) for what seems an eternity (they *are* good you know) it was time for something new.

The [Fugue icon set](http://www.pinvoke.com/) not only surpasses the Silk icons in sheer number but also includes the source Photoshop files and a guide to mix and match the Icons.

Definitely the best icon set I know - for now.
