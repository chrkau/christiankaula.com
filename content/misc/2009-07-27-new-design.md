And there we go again. Since I didn't really feel comfy with the old design anymore I created a new one. I like to call it 'slimbuthappy'.

This is the first step to my three strep world domination, err, I mean site upgrade plan. Since I don't know when I'll be able to make the second step I won't talk about how great and super and totally awesome* all that is which I'm planning. You'll have to check back regularly and see for yourself.
