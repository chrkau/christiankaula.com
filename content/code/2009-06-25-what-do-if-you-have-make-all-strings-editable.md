Well that's what I was told the other day. So I came up with the proposal to misuse [django-better-chunks](http://bitbucket.org/hakanw/django-better-chunks/wiki/Home) as a makeshift database based i18n system. But since I made quite a few changes to the code and wrote some utility functionality I thought 'heck somebody might need just this'.

Long story short: I published my own [django-chunks](http://bitbucket.org/chrkau/django-chunks/) fork on github.org.
