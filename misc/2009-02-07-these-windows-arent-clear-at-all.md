Curious that every operating system I know can be installed on pretty much any partition one desires - save Windows of course.

I'm quite sure I knew this once already: Windows can only be installed on the first hard drive of the system. My pretty worry free life as Mac user probably made me forget some of this... let's call it wisdom. It took me about an hour to remember this Windows 'specialty'. And the error message 'no usable partitions' didn't really help me either.

The solution? Simple: deactivate all other hard drives in the BIOS. Windows will think it will have its earned place right in front and will generously allow you to install it. Voila.
