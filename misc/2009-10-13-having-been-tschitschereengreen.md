Okay so my (ex)boss asked me if I'd like to write a post about his company any my internship there. I said yes and after having moved back home and caught up on sleep a bit I finally feel ready to do so. Here we go.


#### Who are we talking about anyway?

First let's make it clear what company we are talking about. The official name is [Tschitschereengreen - A Brand of the Yoosic Technology GmbH](http://tschitschereengreen.com). Couldn't be any easier, right? Well, I had to write it quite a few time during my half-year internship there, so don't get me started.

It's a rather small company in the heart of Dresden with only just a hand-full of peeps working there. That was a big reason to go there in the first place by the way. They make up by using technologies that allow them to be agile and rapid and all that buzzwordy stuff. That includes frameworks like Django (*dingdingding*) and other open source stuff that Just Works(tm).


#### And You Did What There?

So what did I actually do during my internship there? Surprisingly I worked. Call me crazy but I'm of the opinion that a internship should be just what its name implies: pretend you're a regular employee and do/learn all the stuff a regular employee would do/learn. Work on a tryout basis pretty much - you get the idea.

Most of my time there I had the chance to endeepen (I know that is no word) my Python/Django skills. Another big reason why I chose Tschitschereengreen right there. Besides hardcore Django coding I also did some HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects and took care of some admin stuff like setting up servers and such. I even had a chance to do a small PHP/Wordpress project. PHP is fun in small doses actually.

#### Gimme a Resumé Already

Its been great fun. That's the shortest version. If you want a bit more detail: You probably won't get rich there but hey if money is your main concern you probably will have stopped reading after I mentioned the size of the company. But if you're like me then money isn't your main concern. You rather care about working with nice people and learning stuff by being given responsibility.

If you're in search of a nice internship in the IT area or searching for a full-blown job you should consider Tschitschereengreen. And hey you might even gain some bonus points if you mention you read about them on my blog. :)
