Above you are looking at the front page of [EntryDNS's homepage](http://entrydns.net/pages/home). Quick, tell me what they are selling. *Some kind of free DNS service?* I couldn’t tell either. Let’s see if we can make their copy simpler, more to-the-point.


## What does it do?

Let’s see what their about page says:

> With our service you can create hosts or host your own domains, manage them from the web application or use our API's (simple API and complete REST API) to automate tasks as you wish.<br />
The service gives you a total control of your DNS records without any restrictions.

And this Furthermore these are the listed benefits:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have total control over your domains and records</li>
<li>Host your web site using your own internet connection</li>
<li>Access your computer using a domain name instead of a numerical IP address</li>
<li>Use your home dynamic IP and always have your domain pointing to it</li>
<li>Spend your money on more important things</li>
</blockquote>


## Tell me in simpler terms

To me it seems their focus lies on two groups. Their front page copy seems to target professionals that need customization and automatization. The about pages seems to speak to private enthusiasts that want to host some websites from home.

Why not simply let people know:

> We provide a kick-ass DNS, for free. Automate your  industry-size project with our API or set and forget to access your home PC from anywhere. Did we mention it’s easy?<br/>
&lt;insert easy example here&gt;

It’s kick-ass, it’s free - people like that. The BigFatCo executive might see it and think:

> Automatization means less work. Nobody likes work. I probably should tell Bob from IT. This might just save us millions!

While Joe Shmoe sees it and ponders:

> I always wanted to access my home computer from anywhere. But Bob from IT tells me its really complicated. This seams *easy*, though. I might just have to try it out.

My advice would be to focus on only one group, though. It may be hard to believe for Joe Shmoe that something BigFatCo uses is easy enough for him. Just like the executive of BigFatCo might think Joe Shmoe’s favorite DNS toy can’t possibly be a fit for his multi-billion dollar corporation.

I’m in no way affiliated with EntryDNS in case you wonder.
