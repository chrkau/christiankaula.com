If you are one of those people that totally are into life feeds/streams of... well anything then you will perhaps be interested in [Sweetcron](http://www.sweetcron.com/). It's one of those hip lifestream tools - but if you're a bit paranoid about your personal data (like me) than you probably would rather host something like that yourself. Well with thing thing you can.

By the way I didn't play with it yet but it looks like I'd like to. :P
