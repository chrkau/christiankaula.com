… One is able to write really nice HTML without any inline styles and stuff that is boo-boo. And since I wrote about a bangzillion lines of CSS the last few weeks I was a bit nervous to find out that my way to structure CSS would turn out to be stupid. Turns out it isn't.

'So you super-duper CSS guru tell me how you do it then' I hear you say. Alrighty I say. Here is the general structure:

* html and body tags
* tags
* tags with id
* tags with class

If I have a case of needing to put multiple selectors on top of one code block I put it right before the first occurrence of the first selector. So in general my CSS files look like this:

	:::css
	html
	{
		/* css */
	}

	body
	{
		/* css */
	}


	a
	{
		/* css */
	}

	p
	{
		/* css */
	}


	div#something
	{
		/* css */
	}


	div.somethingelse,
	span.somethingelseyet
	{
		/* css */
	}

	div.somethingelse
	{
		/* css */
	}

	span.somethingelseyet
	{
		/* css */
	}
