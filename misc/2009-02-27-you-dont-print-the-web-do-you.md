Somehow I find it funny that so many web designers and agencies advertise their services with *'pixel perfectness'*. That probably would mean the site looks like the Photoshop template - down to the pixel. Just like with print stuff where you define positions with a precision of three positions after decimal point and it will look *exactly* like that when it's done.

Well someone must have missed the point that the web isn't your average print medium. The web isn't meant to be printed and put into magazine form. It's not important that a site looks the same no matter what - it's important that it looks *good*. And even more important: that it works.
