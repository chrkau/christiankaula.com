Okay so after the Simpsons episode "Take My Wife, Sleaze" was on again tonight I remembered I never actually found out the name of the song that's playing while the bikers crash the Simpsons' house.

After some digging I'm smarter now: It's [Me and the Boys by Dave Edmunds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yOx1nc5TI). Really nice song.
