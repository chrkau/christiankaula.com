Yesterday I reached a point where my Jabberbot groupchat framework started to actually work. Since I couldn't really figure out anything to do with it I thought I could replace all the inherited code with my own stuff. That meant I would pretty much create my own Jabberbot framework.

After thinking that it occurred to me that this might be my fist project anyone might find useful other than myself. Yay for me.
