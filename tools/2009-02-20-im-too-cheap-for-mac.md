Got multiple Macs and don't feel the need to spend money on .Mac? [Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/index.html) to the rescue! This little tool lets you synchronize directory trees and acts like its some kind of simple CVS, meaning it detects conflicts (for example when a file has been changed on multiple Macs) and lets you resolve them.

And did I mention it also does *backups*? Although you probably shouldn't use it as a backup tool. The backup functionality is more like a extra safety measure to make sure you don't overwrite your precious files with versions 3 years old.
