Well yesterday I got me one of those hip Twitter accounts. Yesterday I also got annoyed like hell by it. I'm getting tweets from people that I don't give anything about. Tim O'Reilly? Thanks but no thanks. Who the heck is that Om Malik and Stege Agee anyway and why should I care? And Souljaboy and Ashley Tisdale? Are you fucking kidding me?

They don't even show up as followers. So I try to use the manual commands. Those tell me they are successful and I'm not following them anymore. I try to follow them and kick them out of my list again. Nope. I kill my complete list and it changes... nothing.

So the status page of Twitter says something along the lines of 'well we got follower/following probs let's see what we can do about it'. But those people I get annoyed by seem to be quite well known. Now nobody would say that of course, but what if there is this funky new feature on Twitter that sends tweets to people no matter if they care or not as long as you put enough money on the table? Seems an appealing thought to if I was one of the people in charge.

If this is the Twitter everybody is so crazy about... I don't get it. Why don't we go back to IRC again?
