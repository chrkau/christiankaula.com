So a friend and me wanted to play Worms Armageddon ([which you should buy too](http://christiankaula.com/categories/games/open-a-can-of-worms/)) this weekend. One reboot to Windows on my Mac and one installation of Worms on his Vista laptop later we find out it doesn't work. Asked him if he installed the latest update and he tells me he did. Ask him the version number. He tells me it's the latest he found which makes me think it actually is the latest.

After some more investigation it turns out he installed update 3.0.6.28.0 or something which is the last one that isn't titled beta (I guess). So if you got one of those fancy pancy Vista PCs make sure you get the [v3.6.29.0 Update](http://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/main.html?page=supp&area=upda&file=15). And you do want to play Worms - trust me on this.
