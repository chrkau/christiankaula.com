title: Stuff I Use (All the Time)
slug: tools


Here is some stuff I use on a daily basis and which you should probably give
a try, too. Changes are high you heard of most of it already but just never
got around to try it out. In that case you are likely missing out.



## Mac

Say what you want about this one but Macs Just Work(tm). You pretty much get
a Unix System with a usable (and damn pretty) GUI. I was a Linux guy before and
a Windows guy before that. So I most likely know about most of the advantages
of either system that people try to convince me of. But hey - I coulndn't care
less about what people use as long as they let me use what I want.



## [MacVim](http://compass-style.org/)

Because once I got Vim I couldn't got back. I always was a keyboard guy and no
other editor allows me to work that effectivly.



## [TextMate](http://compass-style.org/)

For HTML/CSS, If I don't feel that hardcore about being super-efficient or simply want to
write text (not code). 



## [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

Because writing plain CSS is repetitive and just not very fun to do overall.
At least not after you tried this one out. And no - I don't use the SCSS 
syntax. Why would I choose to use a metalangue for convenience's sake and then
go back to writing all the repetitive stuff (semicolons, curly braces) I tried
to avoid in the first place?

Also don't forget to use Sass with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). If
Sass is your brand new Ferrari Compass is the nitro boost.
